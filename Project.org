* Situational Analysis

* Internal Analysis
The internal analysis of the company that was conducted focused on the
marketing, human resources, financial and technological functions of
the company. [please continue with your main findings] 
** Marketing Audit
A market audit was conducted in order to gain a clearer picture of the
state of affairs of the marketing function in the company. The main
thematic areas of interest were the marketing environment, strategy, organisation,
systems, productivity and function.
*** Marketing Environment Audit 
The main competitor of the company is Raincoat [Aluminium Company?],
which currently holds about 40% of the total share of the market. The
company is currently the challenger in the market, holding about 30%
of the total market. The target market is broad but products are
offered to the sub-divisions based on income and geographical
location.


The main competitors are the companies that the prospective customers think
about as alternative when buying. The main one is Raincoat. Others are
Rocksters, Lion Aluminium, Alu Africa and K. K. Peprah. Raincoat has
distinguished itself in selling to institutions. It was startling to discover
that the marketing department did not have much to share on their competitor's
strategies. 

Currently, the target markets are individuals and institutions. The high
population growth rate of Ghana[how much?], coupled with a high housing deficit
[how much?] and economic growth[how much?] has led to an associated increase in
the  size of the target market projected growth. This presents both an
opportunity and a threat at the same time, which is discussed further in the
SWOT analysis.

The current estimated market share, according to the marketing manager is about
30%. They may therefore be classified as the market challenger, given that there
is no company with a bigger market share.

The target markets are further sub-divided by income/social class (High class,
mid class and low class) and geographic basis (Coastal area, mid section and the
north). In order to satisfy each sub-target properly, the company offers
different products. Eurotiles are targeted at the high class and also customers
that live near the coastal region. Their IDT and IDR products are aimed at
mid-income earners. All the other products are targeted at low-income earners.

Customers' needs, generally, is not stable in any industry. DBS is no
exception. The market's needs have changed over the years. Current trends include
the need for Eurotiles, which is a new product in the market to suit customers
who want to distinguish themselves. Self-locking roofing sheets which are
cheaper and easier to maintain than strip-lock sheets. Another current trend is
the use of aluzinc trusses to replace wooden trusses. 

The current
product offerings are Eurotiles, inverted box 
rib, Industrial Deep Trough (IDT), Steel Trusses, PVC and aluzinc
raingutters, ridge cap, valley, PVC foam sheet, raden shield, light
gauge steel, modern strip locks and shingles.   DBS provides all of these
products to meet the changing needs of customers.

The company provides a seemingly unsatisfactory credit policy to customers. All
customers, aside from churches are required to make a down payment of 70% with
the rest to be settled within 2 months. Churches are allowed to make a down payment
of 50% with the rest to be settled within 3 months. However, given that in the
cultural context of the country in which it operates, most transactions are done
in cash, it does not seem to be too bad. Aside from this, there were no clear
outward signs of anything that might lead to a bad public perception towards the
company.

The company has 3 main suppliers. They are all exclusive suppliers who sell to
only the company and not to any of its competitors. The company also imports raw
materials. This leaves it vulnerable to the problems of foreign exchange rate
fluctuations. The current strategy is to pass on losses in foreign exchange to
the customers, which is hardly ideal.

Changes in government only affects them when the change in government affects
the general macro-economic enviroment of the country. While this is true for
them, the same could not be said about all their competitors. Some of their
competitors are owned by politicians and a change in government may lead to a
change in profitability and ability to compete. However, their main competitor,
Raincoat is affected in similar ways by a change of government as it does them.
*** Marketing Strategy Audit
The current strategy of the company is to expand their market share
by differentiating system provision of durable products, exclusive
lines, after-sales service. 


The unique benefits that the company tries to deliver to customers include the
following.
 - Durable products. DBS has positioned itself as a leader in the production of
   durable products. As evidence of the durability of their products, they offer
   100 years warranty on their steel trusses and 20 years warranty on their roofing
   sheets.
 - Exclusive lines. They provide some specific products just to suit the unique
   needs of high income earners and customers with a need for a level of
   prestige. To this end, they provide Eurotiles and Shingle Tiles which are new
   products on the market.
 - Services such as delivery, fixing and maintenance checks are provided by
   customers who need them.
 - The company also engages in CSR activities that help to improve its image.
 - High quality products to reduce the number of customer complaints.

The current competitive areas on which the company focuses include the
following. 
 - Widespread distribution. The company has manufacturing facilities in 5
   regions in Ghana. It owns all its warehouses and maintains its distribution
   network itself. The network is extensive enough to cover most of the major
   cities in Ghana and also reach other parts of the country. This provides
   certain advantages such as reduced cost and control over the quality of
   products throughout the whole distribution process.
 - Varied design. All the roofing sheets come in different forms and colors that
   is aimed at appealing to every customer.
 - Varied product phase???????
*** Marketing Organization Audit

 [ Summary paragraph goes here]

 [ Organisational diagram goes here]

 [ A brief description of the marketing department goes here]

 [ Highlight the problem between marketing and other departments here]

In the development of new products, the marketing department is
allowed to conduct market surveys to determine whether there is a
market for the new product.

*** Marketing Systems Audit
*** Marketing Productivity Audit

[Summary paragraph goes here]

The company spends approximately 7% of all sales revenue on advertisement. This,
according to the marketing manager, does not seem to be too excessive given the
amount of growth in sales that has been recorded historically due to
advertisement [Please provide some citation!!!]

Should the company enter, expand, contract or withdraw from any business
segments, and what would be the short and long-run profit consequences?

*** Marketing Function Audit

[Summary paragraph goes here]

The company has been engaged in a program of aggressive advertisements
for the past years. [how long?]. The marketing manager stated that
program seems to be effective, as sales shot up after the program was
initiated.

The company employs both below and above the line advertising
programs. Above the line (ATL) advertisements are aimed at the target market as
a whole and it involves the conventional media. The ATL advertisements
are conducted through the internet, television and radio. Below the
line (BTL) advertisements are aimed at the target market on an
individual level. BTL advertisements that the company has employed
includes the use of fliers. As stated in the Marketing Productivity
Audit above, all these advertisements costs approximately 7% of
revenue. This does not seem excessive as the program, according to the
marketing manager, the increase in sales revenue as a result of
advertising is higher than the cost of advertising.
** Financial Resources
Inflation has great impact, which often leads to higher prices of raw
materials, which affects the prices of finished goods.

Most funds are generated through the issuing of shares to
shareholders, loans and overdraft facility from the banks.

Biggest areas of expenditure are employee motivation (salary, finge
benefits, etc.) and utilities (fuel, plant, etc.)

Current cost reduction strategies involve the following.
    - All facilities shut down at the set time (close of work)
    - Trackers are placed on the company vehicles as a means of
      curbing unneccessary movement.
    - Production of good quality products in order to reduce warranty
      and repair work costs.
** Human Resources
There are approximately 500 employees in the organisation. According
to the General Manager.

To keep staff motivated, there are both extrinsic and intrisic
motivation packages.

Prospective employees are recruited through advertisement, poaching,
use of a pool of C.Vs. 

The process a quite generic, it goes through firs requisition to HR,
then to interview then to final appointment.

Frequent internal employee appraisals are done.
** Technological Appraisal
* External Analysis
** Customers

[Summary paragraph goes here]

Acccording to cite:WinNT Currently, the population of Ghana is approximately 29.4 million, that
is, 2.18% growth from the previous year. 

Customers complaints are taken seriously. All complaints are either
received directly at the office or through phone calls. Each complaint

appropriate action is taken. The company's internal policy is to
prevent defects in the first place reduces the number of complaints

** Competitors
** Industrial Analysis
** Distribution analysis
** Threat of new entrants
** Threat of substitutes
* SWOT Analysis
From the internal and external analysis the we have conducted, we have
identified the unique strengths and weakness of the company and the
threats and opportunities that are present in the external
environment. They are discussed in the following sections.
** Strengths
   - Large branch network. The company has 5 branches, each equipped
     with its own production plant. These have been strategically
     located at places that will help serve each geographical segment
     seperately.
   - Adequate staff strength to help meet all dynamic needs of the
     competitive environment the company finds itself. The staff seem
     to be knowledgeable and can handle product innovations to meet
     customers' needs. The staff undergo periodic training to help
     them meet the changing needs of their customers and also cope
     with new technologies that emerge in the industry.
   - The management of the company have a good interpersonal contact
     network. Through this network, they are able to get
     recommendations from existing customers whose expectations have been met
     or even exceeded.
   - Varied products. The product offerings of the company are quite
     extensive. Each product line also come in different varieties.
   - Due to the size of the company, it can borrow more at relatively
     lower interest rate.
   - The company can offer customized products to customers at
     relatively lower cost.
   - Expertise. The company boasts of 20 years of experience enables them to
     provide top notch quality products and services with the
     availability of quality staff who are trained periodically to
     meet changing needs.
   - Their production costs are decreasing due to economies of scale.
   - High quality products. The company offers very high products and
     their marketing efforts are currently geared to position this
     image unto the minds of the prospective buyers.
** Weaknesses
   - No actual credit facility. The company currently only offers
     credit to religious organisations and to the general public
     during sales promotion periods. Religious organisations are
     required to settle 50% of the total bill on the spot and pay the
     rest within 3 months. All customers, aside from religious
     organisations are 
     required to make a down payment of 70% with the rest to be
     settled within 2 months. 
   - Slow growth in penetrating the international market. The company's plans
     to expand into the West African sub-region has not been very
     successful. Their current market penetration programs have not
     yielded as much success as they would have desired.
   - Not all managers in the organisation have embraced the marketing
     orientation concept. 
** Opportunities
   - Population growth implies that the target market is growing. This means that there is room to
     increase sales.
   - More local events such as festivals and street carnivals are
     avenues that the company can use to promote itself.
   - Increased internet usage among Ghanaians implies more of the
     target demography can be reached in a much more easier and cost
     effective way.
   - The increase in the number of real estate development companies
     creates an opportunity for the company to partner with each of
     these companies in order to increase sales.
   - Currently the housing deficit in Ghana stands at ?????
   - The removal of trade bariers within the ECOWAS region has led to
     an opening up of the West African market to the company.
** Threats
   - New entrants into the industry. They can offer anything at ridiculously low
     prices.
   - Frequent changes in the exchange rate causes the price of their
     product to fluctuate in the market.
   - Inflation within the economy has a significant impact on the
     company because consumers cannot purchase more
     products. Inflation can also lead to higher prices of inputs to
     the company.
   - Frequent changes in utilities bill could impact finances and
     operations.
   - High competition within the industry.
** The Grid
Given the strengths, weaknesses opportunities and threats, we have
created the following grid as a visual representation of our findings.

* Critical Issues

[Summary Paragraph goes here]

In order to address the credit facility problem, the company needs to
develop a credit facility policy which should be aimed at the growing
middle class,loyal customers and institutions

The firm's current policy in dealing with fluctuations of exchange
rate and inflation is to pass it on through prices to their
customers. This in our opinion is not ideal since it causes
flautuations in their market price hence......

On our visit, we realise not all employees embrace the marketting
concept. This is causing the company to lose potential customers. The
firm needs re-orient workers on the importance of marketting concept. 

Currently, the company tries to support only some local
events. However, in order to place itself in more of their prospective
customers' minds, the company
needs to engage itself in even more external events such as
festivals, where some of its target customers will be present.

The company has a website which currently displays some of its
products and some facts about the company. However, the social media links
displayed on the website seem to be malfunctioning. Also, there are
numerous complaints by grieved customers on their facebook page which
have been left unreplied. The company needs to respond to such
customers in order not to create a negative image among their
prospective customers who try to visit their facebook page.

The growing number of real estate agencies in the country presents a
huge opportunity for growth. The company can cash in on the
opportunity by creating the most attractive package for these
companies and also looking out for strategic partnerships with these
companies in order to improve sales.

The activities of new entrants is known to the company. These smaller
firms offer any product that the customer needs at very low prices but
there is no guarantee of the product's quality. The company's current
response is to do adverts that highlight the durability of their
products. As an additional measure, the company can embark on a
campaign to increase awareness in the public about the poor quality of
the new entrants' products.

In our interaction with the marketing manager, there seems to be no
clear document that details the current and projected actions of their
biggest competitors. This means that the company may not be able to
have quick responses to sudden changes in the strategies being
employed by their competitors. To prevent this, the company must start
building a profile on each of its competitors and how they are going
to respond to each of their actions.

When bringing out new products, the following are considered:
 -  What does the customer wants from the product?
 -  What features does the product have?
 -  Sizes and colour available?
 -  How different is the products from competitors product

** Price
DBS makes sure that products are adequately priced. This is done
on a length product retail price. The pricing of a product
goes a long way to determine our profit and surround [What?]. In setting
prices of our products, we factor in the following:

 -  Our cost of production
 -  Customers perceived product [quality?]
 -  Price elasticity
 -  Prices of our competitiors

[With what objective ... Since there is no clear objective, and
given the peculiar strengths of the company, the company should price
in such a way that the quality of the product is communicated to the
customer.
This can only be achieved when there is a good credit facility
available to our selected target market ie. the growing middle class]
** Promotion
Promotion boosts the brand recognition and sales. DBS does not
compromise on this. It is with this view DBS capitalizes on: 

 - Advertising, electronic media electronic media (TV, radio,
   internet), print media (newspapers)
 - Sales promotion: discunts on purchases, partial credit
 - Word of mouth from customers to potential customers.
** Place
Place / distribution is very key to the company. We therefore make it as
much as possible very accessible to our customers as well as
potential customers. At DBS we try as much as possible to have
branches close to customers that is why we are present in Accra,
Kumasi, tamale, takoradi sunyani. All these branches have
manufacturing plants, thus, DBS delivers to the door step of our
customers. We consider the following in distribution:

 - Where our clients are located [Explanation?]
 - How different is our distribution channel different from that of
   competitors
